Here are a number of scout plugins that we have developed for our use.

The following plugins are generally applicable, that is they monitor services or
libraries that are open source or publically available. Feel free to modify this
code and submit patches/pull requests back.

  Reliable Msg Stats
  ==========================
  This plugin generates instantaneous stats on the reliable message service. Currently
  the only stat that is collected is a count of the number of items in each queue.

  Mongrel Cluster Memory
  ==========================
  This plugin records the memory used by each mongrel instance in a cluster. Configure
  it by supplying the directory that contains the PID files for the mongrels.

  RabbitMQ Overall Usage
  ==========================
  This plugin gathers instantaneous metrics about the state of a RabbitMQ server. This
  plugin depends on the 1.5 version of the rabbitmqctl command.

  RabbitMQ Queue Details
  ==========================
  This plugin gathers instantaneous metrics about the state of a single RabbitMQ queue.
  This plugin depends on the 1.5 version of the rabbitmqctl command.

  Rails Session Monitor
  ==========================
  A fork of the Highgroove Session Monitor plugin. This version is patched to work with
  Rails 2.3.4.

The next plugins are pretty specific to the Interactive Mediums environment.
These are unlikely to be usable outside, but feel free to look at the code.

  SMS Stats
  ==========================
  This plugin generates stats on historical messaging activity. This isn't generally
  interesting, unless you happen to work for Interactive Mediums.
