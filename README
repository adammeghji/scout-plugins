Here are a number of scout plugins that we have developed for our use.

Reliable Msg Stats
==========================
This plugin generates instantaneous stats on the reliable message service. Currently
the only stat that is collected is a count of the number of items in each queue.

SMS Stats
==========================
This plugin generates stats on historical messaging activity. This isn't generally
interesting, unless you happen to work for Interactive Mediums.
